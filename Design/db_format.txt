Goal:
Create an application for the museum to help manage their arts database and events such as exhibitions.

1. Manage art objects
    a. Add art pieces to the database
    Every animal can have different properties based on type but some properties are the
    same for example (Name, sex, age, RFID).
    b. Search art pieces and exhibitions.
2. User Management
    a. Add users
    b. Access control
    * access control using sql commands: this requires the creation of roles and users 
    for the database from the sql scrip as shown in the video posted on D2L. the project
    requirement is to manage user access through the application, meaning that you can
    always log in as root and just show the interface corresponding to the prompt 
    selections, which would not prevent a guest from dropping a table if they knew how 
    to inject scripts. for the bonus the login will be using multiple credentials with 
    different access levels as shown in the video recording which will prevent any 
    undesired behaviour by the user. this is worth up to 3% project bonus
    c. Manage users (such as block and suspend)

Consider the following user requirements and functionalities:
    * All the users must log in to the application.

Admins
    • Can add users.
    • Can edit users.
    • Can block users.
    • Can make changes to database (modify tables attributes and constraints)
Data entry users
    • Can add information tuples to the database as long as the information being added meets the database constraints
    • Can modify existing information in the database
End user
    • Can lookup information in the database (ideally a remote user on a website that browses the offerings of the
    museum, but we will have it simulated as part of the main program).
